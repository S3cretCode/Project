In shadows deep, a secret's born,  
Invisible, it hides till dawn.  
A whispered code in quiet guise,  
A riddle wrapped in hidden ties.  

A pattern laid in colors' flight,  
A message veiled within the night.  
Each pixel holds a tale untold,  
A silent word, a cipher bold.  

Not seen, yet felt, it waits to speak,  
A puzzle masked, a clue unique.  
The key is there, just out of sight,  
A thread to pull, to bring to light.  

In silence, through the quiet stream,  
The truth is woven, soft as dream.  
The world may look, but not perceive,  
For what’s concealed, they can’t believe.  

Yet those who seek with patient eyes,  
Will find the words where silence lies,  
And crack the code with sharp mastery,  
Unlocking deep the cryptic tapestry.
